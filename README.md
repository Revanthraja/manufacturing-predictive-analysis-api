# Manufacturing Predictive Analysis API

This project provides a RESTful API and Streamlit interface for predicting machine downtime in manufacturing operations using a machine learning model. It includes endpoints for uploading datasets, training a model, and making predictions.

## Features

- **Endpoints**:
  - `/upload`: Upload a CSV dataset.
  - `/train`: Train a Logistic Regression model.
  - `/predict`: Make predictions using trained models.
- **Streamlit Interface**:
  - Upload dataset.
  - Train model interactively.
  - Predict machine downtime.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Installed dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Revanthraja/manufacturing-predictive-analysis-api.git
   cd manufacturing-predictive-analysis-api
